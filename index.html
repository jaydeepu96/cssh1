        <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span>Css is not neccesary</span> <strong>CSS saves a lot of work.</strong> It can conrol the layout of
            multiple web pages
            all at once</li>

    </ol>
    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documentsin 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside <strong>HTML</strong> elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an External CSS file. <br>
            <span>In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles </span>, becouse this is easier to demonstrate
            , and easier
            for you to try yourself.

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class appiliesa style to multiple elemen. ID,on
        the other hand a style to one unique element.iD is also
        special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS , selectors are used to target a specifie element or range of elements on web page.Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is wide range of selector available. Two of the most commonly used are class ID. Both are used to target
        elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
